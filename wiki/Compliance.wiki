= 17.4.1.3 Freestanding implementations =

2 A freestanding implementation has an implementation-defined set of headers. This set shall include at least the following
headers:
||18.1 Types ||`<cstddef>`||
||18.2 Implementation properties ||`<limits>`||
||18.4 Start and termination ||`<cstdlib>`||
||18.5 Dynamic memory management ||`<new>`||
||18.6 Type identification ||`<typeinfo>`||
||18.7 Exception handling ||`<exception>`||
||18.8 Other runtime support ||`<cstdarg>`||

3 The supplied version of the header <cstdlib> shall declare at least the functions `abort()`, `atexit()`, and `exit()`

TODO: syncronize descriptions with current code base.

==C++ Features requiring runtime support==
 # `try`/`catch` works even in kernel mode with a few limitations.
 # `dynamic_cast<>` included x64 branch only.
 # Static object ctors/dtors support included x64 branch only.
 # `thread_local` not supported yet.
 # floats - FPU flags not compatible to Standard.

==C++ Library Headers==
|| # || <algorithm> || About 45%. ||
|| # || <array>     || Complete. ||
|| # || <bitset>    || In x64 branch only; tested ||
|| # || <chrono>    || In x64 branch only; tested ||
|| # || <codecvt> || Work in progress ||
|| # || <condition_variable> ||Work in progress ||
|| # || <complex>   || Not planned in the near future. ||
|| # || <deque> ||

|| # || <fstream>   ||
|| # || <functional> || Incomplete (no `bind` and refererence_closure) ||

|| # || <ratio>     || In x64 branch only; tested. ||
|| # || <regex> ||
|| # || <set>       || In x64 branch only; untested. ||
|| # || <sstream>   || Incomplete. ||

|| # || <strstream> || Complete. ||
|| # || <system_error> || In x64 branch, native ||
|| # || <threads> || Work in progress ||
|| # || <tuple> || In x64 branch only; tested; incomplete. ||
|| # || <typeinfo>  || Copmlete, but name demangling implemented in x64 branch only (not required by Standard). ||
|| # || <type_traits> || Almost complete (N2723) (no is_standard_layout for MSVC & ICC). ||
