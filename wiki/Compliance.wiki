= 17.6.1.3 Freestanding implementations =

2 A freestanding implementation has an implementation-defined set of headers. This set shall include at least the following
headers:
||18.2 Types ||`<cstddef>`||
||18.3 Implementation properties ||`<cfloat><limits><climits>`||
||18.4 Integer types ||`<cstdint>`||
||18.5 Start and termination ||`<cstdlib>`||
||18.6 Dynamic memory management ||`<new>`||
||18.7 Type identification ||`<typeinfo>`||
||18.8 Exception handling ||`<exception>`||
||18.9 Initializer lists ||`<initializer_list>`||
||18.10 Other runtime support ||`<cstdalign> <cstdarg> <cstdbool>`||
||20.9 Type traits ||`<type_traits>`||
||29 Atomics ||`<atomic>`||

3 The supplied version of the header <cstdlib> shall declare at least the functions `abort()`, `atexit()`, `at_quick_exit()`, `exit()` and `quick_exit()`.

==C++ Features requiring runtime support==
 # `try`/`catch` works even in kernel mode with a few limitations ([http://code.google.com/p/ontl/source/browse/branches/x64/ntl/rtl/ehsup.asm ehsup.asm], [http://code.google.com/p/ontl/source/browse/branches/x64/ntl/rtl/eh.cpp eh.cpp]).
 # Runtime type info and `dynamic_cast<>` ([http://code.google.com/p/ontl/source/browse/branches/x64/ntl/rtl/rtti.cpp rtti.cpp]).
 # Static object ctors/dtors support ([http://code.google.com/p/ontl/source/browse/branches/x64/ntl/rtl/crt.cpp crt.cpp]).
 # I/O Streams support (crt.cpp, [http://code.google.com/p/ontl/source/browse/branches/x64/ntl/rtl/iostream.cpp iostream.cpp]; [http://code.google.com/p/ontl/source/browse/branches/x64/ntl/rtl/wchar_mask_data.cpp wchar_mask_data.cpp] for `wchar_t` specializations).
 # `thread_local` not supported yet.
 # floats - FPU flags not compatible to Standard (`<cmath>` runtime in [http://code.google.com/p/ontl/source/browse/branches/x64/ntl/rtl/math.cpp math.cpp]).

To enable various runtime features, include corresponding [http://code.google.com/p/ontl/source/browse/branches/x64/ntl/rtl/ ntl/rtl/*] files in the build list or project file.

= Technical Report on C++ Library extensions =

== Technical Report 1 ==

[http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2005/n1836.pdf Draft]

The technical report describes extensions to the C++ standard library that is described in the International Standard for the C++ programming language. Almost all library components from it are moved to the C++0x Standard.

NTL contains following separate components, which are based on TR1:
|| # || 2.2 Smart pointers || [http://code.google.com/p/ontl/source/browse/branches/x64/ntl/stlx/ext/tr1/smart_ptr_tr1.hxx <tr1/smart_ptr.hxx>] ||


== Technical Report 2 ==

[http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n2034.htm C++0x Standard Library wishlist]

The TR2 was cancelled in '08 and not published, but you can find C++0x Library extensions in the wishlist.

NTL contains following separate components, which are based on TR2:
|| # || [http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n1975.html Filesystem Library Proposal] || [http://code.google.com/p/ontl/source/browse/branches/x64/ntl/stlx/ext/tr2/filesystem.hxx <tr2/filesystem.hxx>] ||
