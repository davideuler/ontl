= 17.4.1.3 Freestanding implementations =

2 A freestanding implementation has an implementation-defined set of headers. This set shall include at least the following
headers:
||18.1 Types ||`<cstddef>`||
||18.2 Implementation properties ||`<limits>`||
||18.4 Start and termination ||`<cstdlib>`||
||18.5 Dynamic memory management ||`<new>`||
||18.6 Type identification ||`<typeinfo>`||
||18.7 Exception handling ||`<exception>`||
||18.8 Other runtime support ||`<cstdarg>`||

3 The supplied version of the header <cstdlib> shall declare at least the functions `abort()`, `atexit()`, and `exit()`

TODO: syncronize descriptions with current code base.

==C++ Features requiring runtime support==
 # `try`/`catch` works even in kernel mode with a few limitations.
 # `dynamic_cast<>` included x64 branch only.
 # Static object ctors/dtors support included x64 branch only.
 # `thread_local` not supported yet.
 # floats - FPU flags not compatible to Standard.

==C++ Library Headers==
|| # || <algorithm> || About 45%. ||
|| # || <array>     || As in TR1, no tuple interface yet. ||
|| # || <bitset>    || In x64 branch only. ||
|| # || <chrono>    || In x64 branch only. ||
|| # || <complex>   || Not planned in the near future. ||
|| # || <deque> || 
|| # || <exception> || Incomplete (lack of C++0x features). ||
|| # || <fstream>   || * ||
|| # || <functional> || As in C++03, no `bind` & `function`. ||
|| # || <initializer_list> || 
|| # || <iomanip>   || Complete (see iosfwd) ||
|| # || <ios>       || No `ios_base` callbacks, `locale`. ||
|| # || <iosfwd>    || Complete, but no benefins as I/O streams are in development. ||
|| # || <iostream> || 
|| # || <istream>   || Incomplete. ||
|| # || <iterator>  || Complete (?) as in current Standard. ||
|| # || <limits>    || Complete except of `numeric_limits<long double>::infinity()` & Co for ICC (10 bytes in size). ||
|| # || <list>      || No `splice`, `merge`. Redisign is planned to trade O(n) `size()`. ||
|| # || <locale>    || Incomplete. ||
|| # || <map>       || As RB tree now. ||
|| # || <memory>    || `unique_ptr<>` as in N2691, experemental `shared_ptr<>` based on linked list (not thread safe). ||
|| # || <mutex> || 
|| # || <new>       || Complete ||
|| # || <numeric>   || Only `std::accumulate`. ||
|| # || <ostream>   || * ||
|| # || <queue>     || In x64 branch only. ||
|| # || <random> || 
|| # || <ratio>     || In x64 branch only. ||
|| # || <regex> || 
|| # || <set>       || In x64 branch only. ||
|| # || <sstream>   || Incomplete. ||
|| # || <stack>     || As in C++03 but on top of `vector`. ||
|| # || <stdexcept> || Complete. ||
|| # || <streambuf> || As in C++03 (no `swap`). ||
|| # || <string>    || Missed few members and I/O support. ||
|| # || <strstream> || Complete. ||
|| # || <system_error> || 
|| # || <threads> || 
|| # || <tuple> || 
|| # || <typeinfo>  || Copmlete, but name demangling implemented in x64 branch only (not required by Standard). ||
|| # || <type_traits> || Complete (N2723). Requires MSVC 2005 or compatible compiler. ||
|| # || <unordered_map> || 
|| # || <unordered_set> || 
|| # || <utility>   || No `forward`/`move`. ||
|| # || <valarray> || 
|| # || <vector>    || Note stl-exception-safety branch. ||

==C++ Headers for C Library Facilities==
|| # || <cassert>   || Complete. ||
|| # || <ccomplex>  || Not planned. ||
|| # || <cctype> || 
|| # || <cerrno> || 
|| # || <cfenv> || 
|| # || <cfloat>    || Complete. But no runtime support for floats yet. ||
|| # || <cinttypes> || 
|| # || <ciso646>   || Dummy header. ||

|| # || <cstddef>   || No `NULL` macro, use `nullptr`. ||
|| # || <cstdio> || 
|| # || <cstdint> || 
|| # || <cstdlib>   || `FILE` supports only binary mode. `atexit` in x64 branch only. No buffer-overflowing stuff included. ||
|| # || <cstring>   || No `strdup`. ||
|| # || <ctgmath>   || None as ccomplex. ||
|| # || <ctime> ||
